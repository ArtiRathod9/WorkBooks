# 📘 Week 3 -Reletaional Database and SQL
---

## Day 1: Task 1 – Database Concepts

- **Primary Key**: Uniquely identifies each row in a table.
- **Secondary Key**: Used in extended tables, not a unique identifier.
- **Foreign Key**: Links data between tables, referencing a primary key.
- **Relationships**:
  - One-to-One: Driver and Car
  - One-to-Many: Teacher and Students
  - Many-to-Many: Students and Courses

---

## Day 1: Task 2 – Relational vs Non-relational

- **Relational DB**: Structured, tabular, uses SQL.
- **Non-relational DB (NoSQL)**: Uses key-value, document, graph, or column models. Best for:
  - Unstructured/semi-structured data
  - Scalable applications across machines

---

## Day 3: Task 1 – SQL Joins

| Join Type | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Self Join** | Join a table to itself. |
| **Right Join** | All from right table + matches from left. |
| **Full Join** | All records from both tables. |
| **Inner Join** | Only matching records from both tables. |
| **Cross Join** | Cartesian product of both tables. |
| **Left Join** | All from left table + matches from right. |

---

## Day 4: Task 1 – Retail Database Design

### 🏪 **Business Requirements**
- Tables: Products, Customers, Sales
- Users: Managers, Staff, IT Support

### 🗂️ **Tables Structure**
- **Inventory Table**: `productID`, `ProductName`, `UnitPrice`, `Stock`
- **CustomerInfo Table**: `CustomerID`, `CustomerName`, `Email`, `LoyaltyPoint`
- **SalesInfo Table**: `SalesID`, `CustomerID`, `productID`, `Quantity`, `TotalPrice`, `SalesDate`

### 🧱 **SQL Examples**
```sql
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS FastAndFresh;

CREATE TABLE Inventory1 (
  productID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  ProductName VARCHAR(1000),
  UnitPrice DECIMAL(10,2),
  Stock INT
);

CREATE TABLE CustomerInfo (
  CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  CustomerName VARCHAR(1000),
  Email VARCHAR(200),
  LoyalytPoint INT
);

CREATE TABLE SalesInfo (
  SalesID INT PRIMARY KEY,
  CustomerID INT,
  productID INT,
  Quantity INT NOT NULL,
  TotalPrice INT NOT NULL,
  SalesDate DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (productID) REFERENCES Inventory1(productID),
  FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES CustomerInfo(CustomerID)
);
```

### ➕ **Insert Examples**
```sql
INSERT INTO CustomerInfo VALUES (1, 'Dan Healy', 'DanH@hotmail.com', 100);
INSERT INTO Inventory1 VALUES (1, 'Milk', 1.50, 20);
INSERT INTO SalesInfo VALUES (1, 1, 1, 2, 4, '2025-01-04');
```
