## Visualisation with Python
Bar chart 
![pbar](pbar.png)
- The visualization is a horizontal bar chart that shows IMF Estimates of a certain metric (likely economic value such as GDP or funding) across various UN Regions.
- What the Chart Shows:
- X-axis: IMF_Estimate – the estimated value (e.g., in millions or billions).
- Y-axis: UN_Region – different world regions grouped by the United Nations.
- Bars represent the estimated value for each region.
- 📊 Insights:
- Europe has the highest IMF estimate by a large margin, more than double the next highest (Asia).
- Africa has the lowest estimate, indicating lower economic value or funding in this context.
- The World total (13,440) might represent an average or combined subset.
---
Heat Map
![pheat](pheat.png)

- This visualization is a correlation heatmap, and it helps us understand how strongly related the following three estimates are:
- IMF_Estimate
- UN_Estimate
- WorldBank_Estimate
- 📊 Interpretation:
- Comparison	Correlation (Approx.)	Meaning
- IMF vs UN Estimate	~0.65	Moderate correlation
- IMF vs World Bank Estimate	~0.60	Moderate correlation
- UN vs World Bank Estimate	~0.85	Strong correlation ✅
